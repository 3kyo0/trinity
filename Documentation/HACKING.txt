* Building on old distributions.
  Trinity is developed using the latest glibc/kernel, which means from time to time
  changes are introduced which may make it fail to compile on older distributions
  (especially enterprise ones).  The preferred way to fix this is to add the missing
  declarations to compat.h
  This means of course that trinity will be trying to run new syscalls on older kernels
  that don't implement them, but it will only call them once. After the first -ENOSYS,
  it gets marked as "Don't run this again".

* Porting to new architectures
  - Add a syscalls-{archname}.h defining the syscall table in the same order as your arch
  - Add a arch-{archname}.h to define useful things like PAGE_OFFSET
  - Add syscalls/{syscallname}.c for your arch specific syscalls.
  - Change setup_syscall_tables in tables.c to pick the correct syscall table for your arch.
  That should be it.

* Adding new sanitise routines
