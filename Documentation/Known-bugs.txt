- If you run trinity inside a tmux session, sometimes the tmux session gets killed.
  Not sure yet which syscall is causing this to happen, but it gets a SIGINT.

- when we randomly call personality, the child stops logging.

- fuzzing certain syscalls causes segfaults

  - munmap: Looks like we munmap something important.
  - move_pages: possibly a similar bug.
  - modify_ldt: This needs a proper sanitise routine

- fuzzing read() occasionally hangs a long time. Probably a socket ?
  The watchdog _should_ be killing processes that hang, but if they're stuck in D state,
  there's not much we can do. Maybe close that fd so we don't hang on it again?

- Totalling success + failures doesn't always equal the total number of syscalls.
  This is bizarre. We sometimes do a syscall which segfaults, but the SIGSEGV delivery
   doesn't happen until after we've incremented some (but not all) of the counts,
   so we get off by one with every segfault.

- occasionally a thread exits after 0 syscalls. Find out why.

- occasionally trinity fails to startup because we've leaked so much ipc stuff.
  cleanup on startup. (scripts/clean-ipc.sh in the meantime)

- Sometimes all child threads end up in Z state.
  (This may be fixed in 1.0)

- Sometimes we get to get_random_fd() with 0 fd's open.

- The pid map needs locking.
  There seem to be two different races that would be fixed with proper locking.

  [9478] ## Couldn't find logfile for pid 9478
  ## pids:
  ## slot0: 9472
  ## slot1: 9478
  ## Logfiles for pids: 0x24f0300 0x24f05a0 
  ## child logfile handle was null logging to main!

  04c26dec185513631fefe7d8eb8088c30bd98db2 is an ugly workaround for this for now.


  [14874] ## Couldn't find pid slot for 19330
  ## pids:
  ## slot0: -1
  ## slot1: 19642
  ## slot2: 19319
  ## slot3: 19678
  ## slot4: 19631
  ## slot5: -1
  ## slot6: -1
  ## slot7: 19643

  Looks like we reaped a child, but somehow it was still around, and then exited ?

- Occasionally the shm gets corrupted and the counts leap up into crazy numbers
  (and probably a bunch of other state goes awry too). Need to determine which
  syscall is causing this.
