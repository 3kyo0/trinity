Make addresses used by -k 'wander' like -z does.

-u = use userspace addresses
Parse -c arguments so that it accepts '-c sys_open' as well as '-c20'

--numcalls=1000000

--logfile

--nrsyscalls (set NR_SYSCALLS)

flush() & fsync() before making the call

8 args ?

Other arch support. IA64? S390?

skip pause(), and any other functions that take no inputs from userspace.

add a switch to use 32bit syscall entry point on x86-64

Pass "interesting" 32 bit patterns.
	80000000
	80000001
	8fffffff

Pass "interesting" 64 bit patterns.
	0000000100000000
	00000001ffffffff
	0000000800000000 (non canonical RIP?)
	8000000000000000
	80000000ffffffff
	ffffffff00000000
	ffffffff7fffffff
	ffffffffffffffff
	fffffff7ffffffff (non canonical RIP?)

Due to forking of child processes, things like mmap/mprotect etc
don't do anything to affect future calls.  Maybe add a --no-children
to prevent forking?

add a switch to call all the functions that should do a CAP_SYS_ADMIN
check first thing, and check that they all return -EPERM
